abstract: Autonomous driving technology is poised to transform transportation
  systems. However, achieving safe and accurate multi-task decision-making in
  complex scenarios, such as unsignalized intersections, remains a challenge for
  autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel approach to this issue with
  the development of a Multi-Task Decision-Making Generative Pre-trained
  Transformer (MTD-GPT) model. Leveraging the inherent strengths of
  reinforcement learning (RL) and the sophisticated sequence modeling
  capabilities of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), the MTD-GPT
  model is designed to simultaneously manage multiple driving tasks, such as
  left turns, straight-ahead driving, and right turns at unsignalized
  intersections. We initially train a single-task RL expert model, sample expert
  data in the environment, and subsequently utilize a mixed multi-task dataset
  for offline GPT training. This approach abstracts the multi-task
  decision-making problem in autonomous driving as a sequence modeling task. The
  MTD-GPT model is trained and evaluated across several decision-making tasks,
  demonstrating performance that is either superior or comparable to that of
  state-of-the-art single-task decision-making models.
